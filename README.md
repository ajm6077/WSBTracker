# WSBTracker
This is a Flask web app that was created to track Reddit's r/wallstreetbets user sentiment on various tickers.  API calls are made to Reddit via Prawl (a Python wrapper for Reddit's API) and are parsed to find mentions of stock tickers.  The web app uses a simple front end interface allowing users to see number of mentions for each stock ticker and perform an update to the database via an Update button.
# Usage:
To run this web app, run the application.py file
